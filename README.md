# Sales-Demographic-dashboard
I created a dynamic Power BI dashboard to visualize and monitor sales performance and customer demographics. The Sales Dashboard focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) including Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Orders, and Profit Margin. It provides a detailed view of sales by product category, highlights the top 10 products by sales, shows regional sales distribution, and tracks overall sales trends over time. These visualizations help identify best-selling products, profitable categories, and top-performing regions, supporting data-driven business decisions.

The Demographic Dashboard emphasizes customer metrics with KPIs such as Total Customers, Total Unique Orders, and Average Sales per Customer. It highlights the Top 10 Active Customers by order frequency, the Top 10 Most Profitable Customers by revenue contribution, and the Top 5 States based on customer activity and sales performance.

This dashboard enables users to easily spot key customer segments, recognize valuable markets, and monitor important customer trends. It combines clear KPI tracking with actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies, customer engagement, and sales optimization.

Throughout the project, I focused on building a clean, intuitive layout with interactive filters and drill-through capabilities, ensuring users can explore the data in depth. By connecting sales and demographic insights, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of business health, customer behavior, and market opportunities.

This project demonstrates my skills in data modeling, DAX measures, and visual storytelling, using Power BI to turn complex data into simple, actionable insights.
